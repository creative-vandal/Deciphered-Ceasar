I liked physics and chemistry when I was at the university, but I wasn't very good at economics. There was another student, whose name was Jim Green, who was even worse. He was one of the star players on the football team, but he couldn't continue to play if he didn't pass all his examinations. That was very difficult, for though Jim used his big feet very well on the football field, he couldn't m
ake any goals in the classroom. All his professors were very good to Jim and helped him. But especially good to him was our economics professor, a quiet little man whose name was Bassum. He always asked Green the simplest questions, but they didn't seem easy to Jim.
